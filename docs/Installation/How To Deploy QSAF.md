  <br>
</h1>

## Pre-Requisites
Ensure you have checked the [list of pre-requisites]([Get-B1ConnectionProfile](./Pre-Requisites/)).

## Deploy QSAF in Online Environment
Deploying QSAF in an Online Environment is the easiest, as the container can be downloaded directly from the Github Docker Repository.



## Deploy QSAF in Offline Environment
When connecting to the Github Docker Repository is not possible from the Docker Server, you can still deploy QSAF via importing the tarball.
